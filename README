This will keep track of stats for you while you code.

It tracks:

  * compiler errors
  * test failures
  * times you attemted a compile

You use it by typing:

  stats <make target>

And you have to have a Makefile in the current directory.

It saves the stats to a history.db in your current directory.

Then you run dump to get the stats for the day.
